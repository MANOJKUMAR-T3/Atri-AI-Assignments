# Atri-AI-Assignments
The goal of this project is to use the Fashion-MNIST dataset to develop and train a neural network for multi-class image classification. NumPy is used for numerical computation throughout the entire training pipeline, which is written in Python.
The network logic is explicitly programmed rather than relying on pre-existing deep learning frameworks to manage learning automatically. The network structure is defined, predictions are computed, error terms are calculated, gradients are propagated backward through the network, and gradient-based optimization techniques are used to update parameters.Gaining practical experience with the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings of neural networks is one of the main goals of this work. Weights & Biases (wandb) is used to arrange and track experimental runs, allowing for a methodical comparison of model behavior under various training conditions.
